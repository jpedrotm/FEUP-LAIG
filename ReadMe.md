# DSX Parser

This project's goal is to build a DSX parser. DSX means "Description of Scenes in XML" and its purpose is to build a scene using a file.
It is structured using a Scene Graph and you can see how the tags work [here](./DSX_example.txt).

# Create server
Inside the project folder open a terminal and write:
```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
Then just on your browser: http://localhost:8080/
